	Growing up, I found that I am mainly curious about two things: the stories of other people and the power of computation. Over time these interests have pushed me in many different directions, eventually <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wrjv/" target="_blank">pushing me</a> into what could be described as "Computational Social Science". Right now, I study Dutch union dissolution behaviour at <a href="https://nidi.nl/">NIDI</a>. This PhD position allows me to grow, acquiring more knowledge about Social Science, but also use my acquired knowledge of Computational Science and Dutch society so far. However, more importantly, it allowed me to connect with other amazing people as well - this road has definitely been a fun challenge so far!

<!--	In your previous letter you asked me how I ended up in historical demography and computational sociology, and I think it's only fair to provide a good answer to that question. In highschool I always had a broad interest, but my main interests were in history and computer science. While studying Computer Science and Computational Science at the UvA my private genealogy research made me realize that I loved research, and liked explaining human behaviour better than explaining algorithms. I ended up writing two theses about migration behaviour within the Netherlands (both with a link to history as well), which eventually led me to research Dutch union dissolution behaviour at NIDI, where I hope to combine my CS and Dutch demography/history knowledge. This road has definitely been a fun challenge so far! -->
